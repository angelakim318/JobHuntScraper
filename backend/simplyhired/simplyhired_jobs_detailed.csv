We distribute candy, snacks, paper, cleaning, and convenience products to companies all along the East Coast while also growing and pushing West. We’re looking to bring on a Mobile Developer to join our roubust Development team. We're looking for someone with at least 2 years of experience, so if you geek out over coding and building mobile applications, we’ve got a spot for you! A technology company at heart,  we utilize our homegrown software and applications to bridge the gap between big manufacturers (think: M&M Mars, Hershey's, Herr's Chips, if you're looking for a hometown hero) and wholesale distributors to produce greater profit for all. No idea what any of that means? We don't blame you; we’re a pretty niche company with a fast-paced work ethic and a unique family-like culture. Don’t fret, though—we’ll get you up and running quicker than you can say ‘Snickers.’ Established in the 1970s by two Argentine immigrants,  Thayer has continued to disrupt the convenience food channel since we entered the scene. Our founders realized the importance of investing in and creating technology very early on. By doing so, we’ve emerged as the industry leader just 50 years after our company's inception. So, what's it  really   like to work at Thayer?  Glad you asked! Here are some of the things you should be comfortable with as a Thayer developer: 1.  Developing mobile applications. If you're passionate about mobile development and enjoy working with cutting-edge tech, to complete a project from start to finish, we may be the team for you! 2.  Learn. We don't need know-it-alls (we have our bosses for that, am I right?!). We believe that you can always learn and grow, no matter how experienced you are. If you disagree, Thayer might not be the best fit for you (and that’s okay!). 3.  Have fun and integrate into the team. Cliché? Maybe. The truth? Absolutely! We genuinely enjoy working with our teammates. That's why we love our internal and external events, like the annual holiday brunch or company-wide bowling competitions. Anyone looking to take on our reigning ""Chili of the Week"" champion? You'll have your chance but be forewarned: you've got some tough competition. 4.  Collaborating. We ask all our employees to leave their egos at the door. We get along best with team players that enjoy working with others, but also know how to work independently.  That's why we're so adamant that this position is in-person.
